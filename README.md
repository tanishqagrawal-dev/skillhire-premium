## 📌 Project Overview

**SKiL MATRiX Premium** is a modern, AI-inspired career intelligence web platform designed to help students and job seekers understand their **resume strength, skill gaps, and job readiness** in a structured and visual way.

The project simulates how real-world **ATS (Applicant Tracking System)** tools, hiring dashboards, and skill-based platforms work, giving users a clear idea of where they stand and what to improve to become job-ready.

This project is built with a **clean UI, modular components, and a dashboard-based flow**, making it suitable for hackathons, portfolios, internships, and academic evaluations.
