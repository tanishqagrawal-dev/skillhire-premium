# 🚀 SkillHire – Skill-Based Hiring Intelligence Platform

SkillHire is a **skill-based hiring intelligence platform** designed to help students **stop applying blindly** and instead apply with **clarity, confidence, and readiness**.

Rather than acting as a resume checker or job portal, SkillHire **simulates the real hiring pipeline** (ATS screening, company expectations, skill gaps) and guides students **before they apply**, reducing rejections and wasted effort.

## ❗ Problem Statement

> Students apply blindly to companies without understanding eligibility gaps, ATS filtering, or company-specific expectations, resulting in mass rejections and wasted effort.

### Why this is a real problem
- 60–70% resumes are rejected by ATS systems  
- Students rarely know *why* they are rejected  
- One readiness score does not fit all companies  
- Learning paths are generic and not job-aligned  

---

## ✅ Solution Overview

SkillHire transforms job applications from **guesswork to informed decisions** by showing:

- What happens to a resume before a recruiter sees it  
- Where and why rejections occur  
- How readiness changes across companies  
- What skills to improve next
